				<p>My favorite football team is Inter. I don't watch soccer that much, I only watch it when Inter plays. I loved this team since I was 4 years old, and it still is my favorite. I still remember 2010, it still gives me goosebumps. If you ask me about my favorite player, without a doubt I would say Javier Zanneti. The club was founded on 9 March 1908 as Football Club Internazionale. The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players without limits as well as Italians. The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920.</p>

					<p>I have hyperactivity disorders, which means I can't stand still, and I can't stay without doing something. I do a lot of physical activities such as, basketball, gym, swimming, hiking, camping, fishing and a lot more. I went to basketball training for 2 years, then left it after a leg injury. I never joined it again. After that I started going to the gym, which i liked a lot. I also went to the gym for about 2 years in total, and I still go 4 to 5 times a week. Since I started the gym, I sleep better and eat better. <br>Outdoor recreation is something I enjoy a lot. Every year near the end of the summer, I go camping for a week. It is the best thing you can do to calm your mind. Most of the time I sleep inside a tent, but I have slept in the open too. It's pretty awesome. As for hiking, I love it, it doesn't matter if it is winter or summer, hot or cold, it always is great. <br>I also like to shoot pictures of the nature. Below you can see some pictures I shot out in the wild.</p>

					<p>I like guns very much, and I watch videos about guns everyday, I learn about how they work, their mechanisms, defects, etc. I have shot a gun, it was a 9mm Sig Sauer P226. It was awesome! <br>I inted to be a soldier in the future. It always has been my dream to be someone who will protect my country, so that the people sleep peacefully. I hope one day I can achieve that and be the protector of my country and someone who will take care of all the threats.</p>
