                <p>We created this small company on 8th of June 2020. It is a new comapny on the market, but the members have experience on web development. Our team created some beautiful, dynamic web sites/pages. It's a great team, with the willing to work!</p>

                <p>D.A.R.K Pixels has 4 members. Starting of we have Drin Fejzullahu, a boy from Mitrovica. Then we have Arlind Beqiri, another boy from Mitrovica. We have another boy from Mitrovica, named Rilind Idrizi. And last but never the least, Korab Duklini, from a city called Vushtrri. All the members have their own websites, and websites they created for someone.</p>

                <p>If you look at the name, it is creative, but at the first look it doesn't make sense. The name has this meaning: each letter represents the first letter of the name of each member; D stands for Drin, A stands for Arlind, R stands for Rilind and K stands for Korab. Whereas Pixels is more like a visualisation about computer stuff we do.</p>
