					<p>My name is Rilind Idrizi. I was born and raised in a small town, located in the north of Kosovo, named Mitrovica. I was born on 26th of September, 2002, Thursday. I always lived in Mitrovica, so it is the place where I finished both my elementary and high-school. Me and my friends have our own web development company, named <a href="darkpixels.html" target="_blank" id="dp">D.A.R.K Pixles</a></p>

					<p class="text">I started learning programming about 2 years ago. I attended the first online course on a site called Freecodecamp, and I started learning web development, front-end to be precise. At the beginning, I thought it was hard, but then learning everyday more and more, it started to become easier. I built my first website within the first month. It was something really great for me, because it was my first ever project.</p>

					<p class="text">In elementary school I was the best student in my class. I loved all science classes, biology mostly, then came chemistry and so on. I loved reading school books and learning new things. On high-school, I wasn't the best student, but I was a really good one. Even in high-school, I loved science, and it was my priority until I decided to study computer science in university. Now I study in Universum college, Computer Science.</p>
